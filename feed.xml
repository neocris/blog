                <p>struggling in the last 20 years or so with severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emotional paralysis</a>, a term coined by myself to denote the full extent of psychological impedance affecting my everyday endeavours - i set to understand better the emdr cognitive tool said to reprocess the way the mind copes with memories</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emdr</a> (<strong>e</strong><i>ye <strong>m</strong>ovement <strong>d</strong>esensitization and <strong>r</strong>eprocessing</i>) is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neuro reprograming</a> trough techniques devised to reset the way the mind processes memories according to some stimulus</p>
<p>from the way i experience and understand the range of psychological disturbances comprising schyzophrenia i can say honestly that it seems to me the way this tool works is by providing the mind with a kind of detour from the persistent way it processes stressful stimula</p>
<p>biological speaking, we give much relevance to things pervasive to our survival skills; have you ever seen how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meerkats</a> scan their surroundings in search of predators? they seem so focused on the task that they hardly can give way to any other thought other than that, it is essential for their survival. if we could see an heatmap of a brain scan from a meerkat performing this essential task and tag it in some convenient way it probably would show all brain areas fully devoted to it, they can't have the previlege to be any other way</p>

<p>to understand how this could work we must remind ourselfs the way the mind deals and processes memories. as much as the current understanding goes, memories are staggered trough a set of wheights delimiting their relative degree of importance to us in hierarchical form so that they are more or less easily accessible according to this</p>
<p>so when we experience some stressfull or traumatic thought trough remenbrance because of the profound impact we attribute to it it kind of takes over all our brain resources, so our mind doesn't know exactly what is dealing with, it could be a predator for all it knows and we fell in a sort of psychic trance in a freezing state of mind</p>
<p>so when we are presented with aditional stimulus at the precise moment we are going trough this swirling emotional landscape the mind receives a sort of trojan horse on the previous behavioural impact of the memory so that a dissociative connection between the stressful event and the discomfort it arises could be break, because everything that causes personal discomfort must be dealt promptly it has an high cognitive weight associated with it, so if we can blur the stimulus with some ordinary and common one we might degrade the thought down the hierarchical ladder by actively forcing the mind to reprocess the event, hopefuly achieving this by diverting the mind to other stimulus - i borrow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_neuro-linguistic_programming#Milton_model">milton model</a> of neuro-linguistic programming term <em>overloading conscious attention</em> concept to name this 'diversion' - and freeze a new snapshot on memory where our (negative) response was impaired by minifying the cognitive resources devoted to it because we were processing other minful events in paralell at the time, and this way the reprocessing consists of resetting new (lower) weights associated with specific memories. it's like we were telling our mind, look we were only devoting 50% of our brain mass to it (after diverting the other 50% with alt stimulus) so it's no big deal afterall</p>
<p>this is just an alt view to the common way this techniques are perceived, as a kind of free access trap metalanguage to the inner workings of the brain machinery, we know like ctrl signals on conventional network protocols; interesting, this makes me elaborate the all field as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue box</a> to make free calls to the inner mind. wonder shievering, if only could be so simple</p>
<p>this distinction between reprocessing and behavioural output algo can be elaborated further as a sort of compile-time vs runtime effects of cognitive stimula so that emdr seems to act on both, and my own interpretation stresses more upon the later as a technique to calibrate the response pre-programmed on our mind</p>
