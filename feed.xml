<p>china has the benefits of being a dictatorship (yes, it has some), namely their top-level rulers are able to rule without much distraction from opposition, and to deal with dissidents and such there are middle staff to implement party policy. the same can only be achieved in countries with much social trust and lower levels of corruption like norway. democracy is not a win-win situation, bit it has strong potential for further improvement until a sublime cumulus state of anarchy</p>

                <p>there's no way to ignore that alongside history people always felt some numbers to be somehow special. following that tradition the pythagorians were the first that history recorded as attributing numbers and their properties some magical powers to the point where they devised an whole cosmogony around them. since then much has happened on this field and many generations of mathematicians and others have propelled it to a propper subfield of mathematics - the new pytagorians dwelve on number theory</p>
<p>there are some numbers that intrigued whole generations and deserve some special place among them like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">pi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">e</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a>, and even an whole class of them like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primes</a>. but almost since ever the numbers 3, 7, and 12 are among the most notorious for us humans. why? as to the why an eminent proposal from psychology is the eponymous miller's law also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the magical number seven plus or minus two</a> which roughly states that humans are capable of retain simultaneously 7 plus or minus 2 things on memory, that is to say in the range of 5 to 9. i like to extend this theory also to the numbers 3 and 12, and i wish to elaborate on this a little further. incidently i devised this before i was aware of the seminal paper by the eminent cognitive psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">george miller</a> with an obvious more prolific account and scientific background, but nevertheless besides the lack of test empirical data to support my assertion and based only on pure intuition (not very scientific on my part, i know) i choose to give this account for historical reference on my thought on the matter based on a 3-7-12 premise rather than miller's 5-9. but you are advised to go for miller on this, otherwise anyone can consider this as just a minor extension or complement to miller's main points</p>
<p>we all recognize that altough not the only thing in the picture, memory plays a significant role on intelligence; the ability to process is intrinsically connected with our capacity to store information, not at least because information is a raw derivative of the act of processing, to process information we must store and discard at multiple levels some info instrumental for the calculus of whatever we are processing, so information produces information and relies itself on information. sometimes, specially on the computer science field, we distinguish between those various kinds of information as data and information propper to denote their roles on information processing</p>
<p>therefore, my thesis goes, these numbers are strongly correlated to our ability to paralell processing of information. so, people with disabilities or cognitive impairments can process or memorize 3 things a time at most, most people can do it around 7 items, and very smart ones can do above twelve. but although even 12 things can be quite remarkable it's not good enough for the current state of civilization so we humans learned to categorize things so that those items can be themselfs whole sets of related things and therefore we can extend our limited capacity to retain information as long as those things can be related trough our pattern matching abilities relying them on senses or inductive reasoning. for instance, we are able to consider at any time the whole set of natural numbers, that is, given some specific number n we can produce its successor. we are able to do that because we recognize the sequential order pattern inherent on natural numbers, but if are given some n randomly distributed numbers from the natural set we are limited by our inner ability to store simultaneously unrelated items</p>
<p>that way, this being true, it's no surprise that intuitively we grant such relevance to those numbers, because they are kind of immersed on our cognitive machinery to process information, they are natural registers of our mind processor, the brain, if you are so computer hardware inclined. and by no means that is exclusive of humans since numbers and patterns are everywhere on nature and from plants to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nautilus</a> (their shells grow at a constant pace denoted by the golden ratio) numbers seem deeply rooted on our ability to evolve and survive. in that perhaps relies some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences"></a><a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a></p>

                <p>schyzophrenia can be viewed as a multi-layer conception of reality by the mind. that's not saying much about schyzophrenia as a patologic symptom because everyone is capable of possess many conceptions of reality immersed on their minds, but on schyzophrenia patients this seems to reach a more deep level than usually</p>
<p>in schyzophrenia patients an alt reality performs an escape role from the perceived reality to an extent that he can gradualy lose conection with that reality. it's like the mind builds an alt universe to escape the deep level of pain the patient feels on his everyday life. it's the negation stage of dealing with pain but raised to an extreme level</p>
<p>it is my belief the patient constructs a model of the world on his mind where he acquires more control sense over it compared to reality itself. on this virtual world he builds for himself he feels he can survive because somehow he is able to deal with it and that way it reliefs pain; it works as a refuge from outer reality. he can do that by chosing to unconstiosnly ignore the most traumatic and problematic facets of the problems he felts by repressing those memories connected to them, that is he sets zero weights on them</p>
<p>these synptoms can be either individual or collective. they are akin to conspiracy theories. supose an individual is reading a book and he finds the events related there so close to his own experience that he transfers them to himself and adapts his perceived reality to this new view over it. now he can adopt the plot to try to resolve some of his own troubles. the same way supose there's an economic breakdown and some ideology proposes that some sect is to blame. if this seems reasonable to some than they gain an explanation for theis misfortune and lose some sense of impotence because now they have managed to identify the source of the problem they can do something about it (like exterminating the jews) and at the same time gaining some sense of control and losing the sense of impotence that was steering their lives. in this view conspiracy theories are nothing more than a degree of collective schyzophrenia</p>

                why do above average people seem more prone to depression than the rest? this has troubled many eminent practitioners on the field. personally i think this might relate to the fact that inteligent people are more introspection-like kind of persons and introspection is a double-sword gun that diverts us from the biological defence walls of instinct. instincts are pre-programmed reflexes that help us in dealing with matters and improve our overall well-being, but they are dogmatic since they are kind of automatic responses. but as humans we are above the strict realms of instinct since we like to contest and doubt preconceived assumptions, and introspection is instrumental in this; but derailed doubts can be dizzy since it blocks us from the mental anchors of our confort zone. this is what makes humankind evolve in the end ant this might also be why are the most accomplished of us, who set the stage for civilizational evolution and progress, the ones who sacrify themselfs more on the process

                <p>struggling in the last 20 years or so with severe <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/3">emotional paralysis</a>, a term coined by myself to denote the full extent of psychological impedance affecting my everyday endeavours - i set out to understand better the emdr cognitive tool said to reprocess the way the mind copes with memories</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emdr</a> (<strong>e</strong><i>ye <strong>m</strong>ovement <strong>d</strong>esensitization and <strong>r</strong>eprocessing</i>) is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neuro reprograming</a> trough techniques devised to reset the way the mind processes memories according to some stimulus</p>
<p>from the way i experience and understand the range of psychological disturbances comprising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schyzophrenia</a> i can say honestly that it seems to me the way this tool works is by providing the mind with a kind of detour from the persistent way it processes stressful stimula</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left" ><img src="file://C:/Users/Casa/Documents/Publii/sites/blog/input/media/posts/2/640px-Meerkat_feb_09.jpg" width="640" height="1254">

<p>biological speaking, we give much relevance to things pervasive to our survival skills; have you ever seen how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meerkats</a> scan their surroundings in search of predators? they seem so focused on the task that they hardly can give way to any other thought other than that, it is essential for their survival. if we could see an heatmap of a brain scan from a meerkat performing this essential task and tag it in some convenient way with an apprpriate marker it probably would show all brain areas fully devoted to it, they can't have the previlege to be any other way</p>
<p>i'm not pretending to be scientificaly accurate or precise over this, only to acquire a good enough metaphor to what's going on the background to get an usefull insight. i don't really know if a thought can take over all brain activity or not but it sure feels that way on certain moments like on panic attacks. i like to call it, and excuse me for the f-word, <em>mental masturbation</em>, because the brain is fouled by our virtual thoughts to trigger specific fisiologic responses when those thoughts connect with some memories set above some threshold; the same way a guy can foul the brain as being laid with a hot women, some thoughts have such a negative impact that they foul the brain into setting off a panic attack like the individual was being persuited by a predator or something</p>
<p>to understand how this could work we must remind ourselfs the way the mind deals and processes memories. as much as the current understanding goes, memories are staggered trough a set of wheights delimiting their relative degree of importance to us in hierarchical form so that they are more or less easily accessible according to this scheme</p>
<p>so when we experience some stressfull or traumatic thought trough remenbrance because of the profound impact we attribute to it it kind of takes over all our brain resources, so our mind doesn't know exactly what is dealing with, it could be a predator for all it knows and we fell in a sort of psychic trance in a freezing state of mind where the brain locks momentum (as in cognition stream block) upon the object of distress, a tipical outcome in situations of panic attacks and schizophrenia; it is sort of like time stops and the mind momentarily desynchronizes with reality flow. anyway, in this view brain activity works as a sort of emotional metric over the perceived impact of the memory</p>
<p>therefore, my hypothesis goes, there is a correlation between the relavance of our memories (asserted by the weights we set on them) and the focus the mind devotes to it: the stronger the relevance the harder the brain focus on it. on extreme cases this focus can degrade to a fixation (broadly speaking, not exactly connected with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixation</a> concept from psychanalysis) on the subject of those memories, and we can conceive their behavioural output as conditioned responses</p>
<p>so when we are presented with aditional stimulus at the precise moment we are going trough this swirling emotional landscape the mind receives a sort of trojan horse on the previous behavioural impact of the memory so that a dissociative connection between the stressful event and the discomfort it arises could be break.</p>
<p>because everything that causes personal discomfort must be dealt promptly it has an high cognitive weight associated with it, so if we can blur the stimulus with some ordinary and common one we might degrade the thought down the hierarchical ladder by actively forcing the mind to reprocess the event, hopefuly achieving this by diverting the mind to other stimulus - i borrow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_neuro-linguistic_programming#Milton_model">milton model</a> of neuro-linguistic programming term <em>overloading conscious attention</em> concept to name this 'diversion' - and freeze a new snapshot on memory where our (negative) response was impaired by minifying the cognitive resources devoted to it because we were processing other minful events in paralell at the same time.</p>
<p>this way the reprocessing consists of resetting new (lower) weights associated with specific memories. it's like we were telling our mind, look we were only devoting 50% of our brain mass to it (after diverting the other 50% with alt stimulus) so it's no big deal afterall</p>
<p>so far i have been talking about weights without giving much thought on the precise nature of them. being a layman person interested in this by virtue only of self-interest i have the liberty to allow myself to speculate freely without being absolutly rigorous or self-demanding to prove my assertions that a professional or a scientist wouldn't possess - nevertheless don't forget that theories arise too often if not always from pure speculation. that been said, i postulate that the way the brain implements the so called weights to echelon memories on the mind is by their cardinality, that is, the number of times we remember them, where the rational is that we remember, and therefore access, the most important (to us) more often than the others and so are given top priority over the others, that is we remember them better, so to speak</p>
<p>did you know that people with mental degenerative deseases like alzheimer forget ancient memories last and the newer ones first in what we might call a lifo model of remembrance. this makes some sense since we tend to learn the most important skills for survival when younger and the brain doesn't had enough time to settle the new ones as important as perused in my proposal. it is something like the way google indexes webpages since the ones that are most accessed come upfront and therefore are better remembered because of that</p>
<p>in conclusion, this is just an alt view to the common way this techniques are perceived, as a kind of free access trap metalanguage to the inner workings of the brain machinery, we know like ctrl signals on conventional network protocols; interesting, this makes me elaborate the all field as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue box</a> to make free calls to the inner mind. wonder shievering, if only could be so simple</p>
<p>this distinction between reprocessing and behavioural output can also be elaborated further as a sort of compile-time vs runtime effects of cognitive stimula so that emdr seems to act on both, and my own interpretation stresses more upon the later as a technique to calibrate the response pre-programmed on our mind and added to our toolbox repertoire to manage stressful situations, like breath control or meditation</p>
