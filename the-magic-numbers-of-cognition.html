the ability to process is intrinsically connected with our capacity to store information, not at least because information is a raw derivative of the act of processing, to process information we must store and discard at multiple levels some info instrumental for the calculus of whatever we are processing, so information produces information and relies itself on information. sometimes, specially on the computer science field, we distinguish between those various kinds of information as data and information propper to denote their roles on information processing</p><p>therefore, my thesis goes, these numbers are strongly correlated to our ability to paralell processing of information. so, people with disabilities or cognitive impairments can process or memorize 3 things a time at most, most people can do it around 7 items, and very smart ones can do above twelve. but although even 12 things can be quite remarkable it's not good enough for the current state of civilization so we humans learned to categorize things so that those items can be themselfs whole sets of related things and therefore we can extend our limited capacity to retain information as long as those things can be related trough our pattern matching abilities relying them on senses or inductive reasoning. for instance, we are able to consider at any time the whole set of natural numbers, that is, given some specific number n we can produce its successor. we are able to do that because we recognize the sequential order pattern inherent on natural numbers, but if are given some n randomly distributed numbers from the natural set we are limited by our inner ability to store simultaneously unrelated items</p><p>that way, this being true, it's no surprise that intuitively we grant such relevance to those numbers, because they are kind of immersed on our cognitive machinery to process information, they are natural registers of our mind processor, the brain, if you are so computer hardware inclined. and by no means that is exclusive of humans since numbers and patterns are everywhere on nature and from plants to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nautilus</a> (their shells grow at a constant pace denoted by the golden ratio) numbers seem deeply rooted on our ability to evolve and survive. in that perhaps relies some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences"></a><a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a></p><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 18, 2018</p></div><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fneocris.github.io%2Fblog%2Fthe-magic-numbers-of-cognition.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://neocris.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fneocris.github.io%2Fblog%2Fthe-magic-numbers-of-cognition.html&amp;via=blog2&amp;text=the%20magic%20numbers%20of%20cognition" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://neocris.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fneocris.github.io%2Fblog%2Fthe-magic-numbers-of-cognition.html" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://neocris.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fneocris.github.io%2Fblog%2Fthe-magic-numbers-of-cognition.html&amp;media=undefined
